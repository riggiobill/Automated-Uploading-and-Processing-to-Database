# Automated-Uploading-and-Processing-to-Database
Set up an easy automation command for cleansing, uploading, and processing daily data for an international shipping company client. 


To perform this task, I built a Python script that cleanses a daily update of data, connects remotely to a digital database service, and then uploads and processes the data. This was automated through the use of a .bat file as a service.
